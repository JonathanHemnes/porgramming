## At what level of management do you become a leader? 



It's a trick question.  There is no level of management that will make you a leader. **Anyone at any level can become a leader**. A leader is someone that inspires others towards a common goal. If you find an area of improvement and then work with those around you to solve that problem, you’re a leader.  There is no problem too small for a leader.  Here are the steps to solving a problem like a leader:

1. Identify a problem
   * Is there a part of your job that frustrates you and others? 
2. Think of an idea to make it less of a problem
   * Is there a change you can make that will make it less frustrating?  Of note, you don’t need to solve the problem, just think of a way to make it less of a problem.
3. Think of another idea to make it less of a problem
   * Yes, do it again. All problems have many solutions. You should prepare for someone to tell you a very valid reason why you’re proposal won’t work.
4. Critique your ideas
   * Make sure that your solution moves you in the direction that actually solves a problem.  A stitch may hurt more to put it, but it will heal a deep wound better than a band-aid.
5. Know your stakeholders
   * Find everyone affected by your proposed changes. Talk to them and understand their perspective.
6. Create a sales strategy for your ideas
   * Understand the pain of the problem you are trying to solve. 
   * Personalize your sales strategy to each individual stakeholder. Be prepared to explain to your teammates that your solution will ease that pain.
7. Tell your plan to anyone who will listen
   * It's your job now to sell everyone who will listen your vision.
   * Listen to their feedback. Think critically about their feedback.  If it's valid, incorporate it into your solution.
8. Start implementing
   * The more people that you have on board with your proposed solution, the easier it will be to put in place.  You may even find that there is a critical mass that once achieved, the change will naturally happen.



In short, you don't need permission to be a leader.  There is no ceremony that makes a person a leader.  It's a decision that you make, and a set of steps.  As you practice those steps, you'll get better at it.  After you do this a few times, you'll find yourself with plenty more leadership opportunities!  Other leaders are always on the lookout for those with a willingness to lead.  Those leaders are often in a position to give you more challenging opportunities.
